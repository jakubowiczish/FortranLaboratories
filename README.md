## My solutions for Fortran assignment

## This repository consists of solutions to laboratory tasks and to 3 bigger projects

### Project 1 - Various methods of matrix multiplication

### Project 2 - FFT and some stuff

### Project 3 - Various methods of integration, multi-threading in Fortran

#

#### Lab 1 - introduction to Fortran, some basic methods

#### Lab 2 - mymath module - some basic mathematical operations

#### Lab 3 - complex numbers module

#### Lab 4 - unfinished module, something with triangles and cat operation

#### Lab 5 - calling Fortran methods in Python - writing a wrapper

#### Lab 6 - multi-threaded program that determines value of PI

####  Lab 7 - c2f, f2c, more multi-threading
